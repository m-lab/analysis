See: [MLab BQ Inspection and View Test Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SkrYGzhpLijALxHzArNUlbCtMJVoWdAoyHRFsSKYvGk)

Most of the tools here use dockerized python/Jupyter.

* *Plottools* use Jupyter to provide easy methods for querying and exploring the data and
rapid prototyping native python scripts.

* *scripts* contains dockerized (hermetic) diagnostic and test scripts.
